Intro

view j/s it's a JavaScript framework for

0:02
building front-end UIs in view you can

0:04
start simple and then progressively add

0:06
in the tools and features that you need

0:07
to build a complex web application at

0:10
its core it provides a way to build

0:11
components that encapsulate data or

Vuejs Components
0:13
state in your JavaScript and then

0:15
connect that state reactively to a

0:17
template in HTML we call these

0:19
components declarative views because the

0:21
same data inputs will always produce the

0:23
same output in the visual UI when we

Vuejs Data
0:25
declare data on this data object it

0:27
links or binds it to the HTML on the

0:29
template above when the value of the

0:30
data changes the component will

0:32
automatically rerender or in other words

0:34
it's reactive and the framework does a

0:36
ton of work under the hood to make sure

0:38
that this process is performance across

0:39
a huge component tree we can work with

Vuejs Template
0:41
this data in the template thanks to

0:43
views HTML based template syntax we can

0:45
interpolate a value for expression using

0:48
double braces and we also have a variety

0:50
of directives to control the behavior of

0:52
the HTML based on the data we can use VF

0:54
to only render an element when the value

0:56
on the right side is truthy and then we

0:58
might have a fallback element after that

1:00
that's only rendered when the values

1:01
fall C with V else we can make the app

Vuejs declarative
1:04
interactive by listening to events using

1:06
the V on directive we can listen to an

1:08
event on an element then run some code

1:10
to handle that event on the right side

1:12
we can do that directly in the template

1:13
or define a custom method and the

1:15
components methods object the method has

1:18
access to our reactive data and that

1:19
means all we have to do is change the

1:21
value of the data and the component will

1:23
automatically rerender and that's all it

1:25
takes to build an interactive reactive

1:26
declarative UI component with view the

1:28
framework is loved by developers for the

1:30
simplicity but also its ability to scale

1:32
up in complexity incrementally its

1:34
plugin system allows you to easily drop

1:36
in things like a router state management

1:38
firebase support and more and perhaps

1:40
best of all it's not sponsored by some

Conclusion
1:42
mega corporation it's not pressured to

1:44
push out new releases all the time and

1:46
does a great job listening to its

1:47
community this has been GU Jas and 100

1:49
seconds stay tuned for a full length

1:51
tutorial here on YouTube in the near

1:52
future and check out my view firebase

1:54
course on fire ship if you're ready to

1:56
start building a full stack app thanks

1:58
for watching and I will see you in the

1:59
next one
