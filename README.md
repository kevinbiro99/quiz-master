# Brief Description of the Web Application:	
QuizMaster is an innovative web application that generates real-time multiplayer quizzes from video content. Users can upload their own videos or provide YouTube links. The application parses the audio to text, integrates with ChatGPT to create quiz questions, and cuts the video to reveal the answers.

# Required Elements Fulfillment:
- **Frontend Framework**: The frontend will be built using Vue 3 to ensure a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: The frontend will be a SPA, providing a smooth user experience without page reloads.
- **Backend API**: The backend will use Express as the core API, ensuring a robust and scalable server-side architecture. We will use a SQL backend like PostgreSQL to store users and quizzes for our application.
- **RESTful API**: The application's API will follow RESTful principles for clear and predictable interactions.
- **Deployment**: The application will be deployed on a Virtual Machine on Google Cloud using Docker and Docker Compose. All deployment files, including CI files for building images, will be committed to GitHub.
- **Accessibility**: The application will be publicly accessible (hosted with a public URL on Google Cloud) without requiring any interaction with the development team.
- **Third-party API**: The application will use any API that can do audio to time stamped transcripts (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API) and will also use OpenAI API for ChatGPT integration to generate the quiz questions.
- **OAuth 2.0**: OAuth 2.0 will be implemented for user authentication, allowing users to sign in with their Google accounts. Can use the vue3-google-login plugin to achieve this.

# Additional Requirements Fulfillment:
- ### Real-time Functionality:
  - The application will use WebSockets to provide real-time updates for quiz sessions, reflecting user answers and score changes instantly during the question.
  - When a user clicks on an answer, other players can see a live update of the tally (correct / incorrect), and when everyone has answered, a bar graph is shown of quiz answers with the correct one highlighted and a leaderboard is updated.
- ### Long-running Task:
  - Generating the quiz from a video will take >10s to complete
    - Extract the audio from the video
    - Send audio to Google Cloud text to speech API (or Whisper) to get text from the video with timestamps (split the video into relevant chunks for the quiz questions)
    - Query the api of some natural language model with the extracted text to give quiz questions with answers found in the video (can take some time if we want high quality answers).
    - Find the answers to each question in the text and associate it with video timestamps of when they occur in the video
    - Create clips of the video answers to play after each question (optional toggle if player gets a question wrong or wants a reference).
